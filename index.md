## About me

I am a PhD student on Information and Telecommunication Technologies at the University of Valladolid (Spain), focused on Biomedical Engineering. Since October 2019, I was hired by the [Biomedical Engineering Group](http://www.gib.tel.uva.es/?lang=en_EN). 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/VictorGDP/VictorGDP/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/VictorGDP/VictorGDP/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
